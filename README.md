# gym-schedule

An Android app written in Kotlin that retrieves and displays the daily gym schedule for [Markham Rudy Bratty YMCA](https://ymcagta.org/find-a-y/markham-rudy-bratty-ymca).

Users can view event details such as start and end time, age range, and registration fees.

Users can also filter the gym schedule to only show events that they're interested in.

Upcoming features:
* location picker to select other YMCAs in the GTA
* sub-event filtering (ex. breaking down "Fitness Classes" into "Strength Training", "Cardio", etc)
* ability to set an alert for an event
